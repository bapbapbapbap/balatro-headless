# Hypotheses (pre-registered)

Written 2026-11-01 ~20:25 CST, while the v1 overnight run was in progress and before its results
were known. The git commit that adds this file is the registration timestamp. Changes after this
point get a new dated section; nothing above it is edited.

Status of every item: **proposed**. Thresholds marked *(chud to confirm)* are drafts until he
confirms or changes them.

## A. The v1 overnight run (Red Deck, White Stake, reward `blinds` + shaping, unmodded 1.0.1o)
State at registration: ~5,000 training games, 10-round training average ~6.6 blinds/game, best
sampled eval 5.58 blinds/game (200 fixed seeds), 0 wins.

- **A1. It keeps learning.** At 100,000 training games, the 10-round training average is at least
  8.0 blinds/game. *Falsified* if below 7.0.
- **A2. First wins.** At least one training game is won (ante 8 boss beaten) before 100,000 games.
  Weak prediction; no confidence attached.
- **A3. The eval loop is a free-action cycle.** The capped evaluation games in
  `eval_capped.jsonl` end in repeated free actions (joker drags back and forth, or similar), not
  in a sim fault. *Falsified* if any capped game shows the game itself not progressing on a
  non-free action.
- **A4. The sim stays exact.** The pre-flight checks pass at every restart and no safety alert
  reports a sim error. Any sim error found falsifies "perfect accuracy" for that path and blocks
  all results until fixed.

## B. Shaping is speed, not values
- **B1.** Potential-based shaping changes how fast the bot learns, not what it ends up preferring:
  two runs identical except `--shaping 1` vs `--shaping 0`, given enough games, converge to the
  same blinds/game within noise. Practical test: compare at a fixed game budget once compute
  allows the unshaped run to learn at all. Until then, the claim rests on the theorem
  (Ng, Harada & Russell 1999), not on our data.

## C. Isolating oughts (the main experiment)
Facts held fixed: the game (pinned version, same seeds, same sim). Varied: the reward, the only
place an ought enters.

- **C1. Different oughts, different behavior.** Bots trained on `blinds`, `antes` and `win` play
  measurably differently on the same seeds: skip rate, reroll rate, money held, joker picks.
  Test: per-seed paired comparison of those statistics. *(chud to confirm the statistics)*
- **C2. An ought that isn't the goal can beat the goal at the goal.** Judged on win rate, a bot
  trained on `blinds` or `antes` wins at least as often as one trained on `win` at the same compute.
  The yardstick (win rate) is itself an ought and is named as such in any write-up.
- **C3. Bot vs chud.** On held-out paired seeds (Ghost Deck, Purple Stake, modded 1.0.1o), the
  bot's win rate is compared with chud's: McNemar test on per-seed outcomes. Direction not
  predicted. *(chud to confirm N, the held-out split and the significance level)*

## D. Before the main training (what still has to be done)
1. **Reward of record** for the main experiment (chud's decision).
2. **Game of record**: modded (matches chud's logged games) or vanilla. Proposed: modded.
3. **Target config**: Ghost Deck, Purple Stake; env and eval switched over and re-verified.
4. **Play order**: controls mode (or ordered selection), so plays like Photograph-first are expressible.
5. **Endless mode** in the env (needed for naneinf work; not for the main experiment).
6. **Eval loop** understood and handled (A3), so evaluation is trustworthy at scale.
7. **chud's dataset pipeline**: logs → verified (state, legal actions, chosen action) records,
   each log replayed with 0 mismatches before it's used.
8. **Pre-registration numbers** for C3: N, held-out split, test, threshold.
9. **Compute plan** for 1M+ games on the target config (laptop, or rented x86 cores).
